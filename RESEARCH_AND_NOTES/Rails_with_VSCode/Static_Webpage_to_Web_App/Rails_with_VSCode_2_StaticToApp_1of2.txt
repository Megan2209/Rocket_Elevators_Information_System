Gems are software packages containing a packaged Ruby app or library (collection of prewritten code users can use to optimize tasks)
Gems are used to distribute reusable functionality for other Ruby users to use in their apps
After initializing a new Rails database:
app Folder
	app/assets contains things like CSS stylesheets, Javascript code, images, etc.
	app/controllers
	app/models
	app/layouts
config Folder
	config/routes.rb

Gemfile
	Gemfile contains gems to be used with project

Rails has many helper files to help with webpage creation (E.G. generators)
IN TERMINAL:	rails generate OR rails g
Initialize website with Rails generator:	rails g controller home index
					creates controller made at home, creates page called index
All Rails HTML files end in .erb, allows developer to use embedded Ruby on web page
Upon creation, localhost:3000/home/index now displays a mostly blank page with a Home#index header
To change index file, go to VSCode - app/views/home and change index.html.erb
To have home page display index instead of the Rails page, change route by going to:
	config/routes.rb
		Comment out:	 get 'home/index'	Remember the single quote marks!
		Next line under: 	root 'home#index'
